# CCN-LAB-PROJECT BU
Bahria University Network Communication System
This repository contains the network design and configuration for a multi-campus communication system across Bahria University's Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi campuses. The system ensures secure, structured, and segmented communication between laboratories in each campus, utilizing DHCP, RIP routing, and Access Control Lists (ACLs) for network management and security.

Key Features:

Inter-campus Communication: Configured DHCP pools for each campus, allowing for automatic IP assignment across various labs.

RIP Routing: Implemented RIP routing protocol for dynamic routing between campuses.

VLAN and ACL: Although VLANs were not used, ACLs are configured to restrict access to specific labs while allowing a Rector's computer administrative access across campuses.

Web Interface: Developed HTML websites for each campus with restricted access based on the network segment.

Simulation and Testing: The network configuration has been simulated and tested to ensure proper operation.

This project serves as a practical implementation for structuring a secure and efficient campus-wide network communication system.
